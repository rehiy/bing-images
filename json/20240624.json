White/Minden Pictures","desc":"Atop Kelimutu, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Flores, sit three lakes, each with its own hue and folklore. Volcanic vents deep within the Earth release steam and gas that alter the lakes' mineral compositions, creating different colors, which can change independently. The westernmost lake, Tiwu Ata Bupu (Lake of Old People), not pictured, normally has a dark blue hue. Meanwhile, Tiwu Ko'o Fai Nuwa Muri (Lake of Young Men and Maidens), tends to be light green or light blue and Tiwu Ata Polo (Bewitched or Enchanted Lake) can be red, dark green, blue or brown. The local Lio people revere these lakes, believing them to be the resting place of souls.","date":"Jun 24, 2024","bsTitle":"The sacred lakes of Kelimutu","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240624_FloresIsland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cd283deaacad1af96e7e026d3bb21182","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
