These 'tulou' structures, built between the 12th and 20th centuries, are the dwellings of the Hakka community in China's mountainous southeastern Fujian region. The homes are constructed from clay, sandy soil, and gray tiles, with bamboo strips serving as the support. They were built to house a whole clan, up to 800 people each. From above, these round dwellings look like giant tires or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs, and spacious interiors.","date":"Apr 29, 2024","bsTitle":"In perfect shape","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240429_TulouFujian%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"794439e2a2f004f551d42ae66158d5a2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
