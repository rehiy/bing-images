Lupines were introduced here in the 1940s for their soil-binding properties, to reduce erosion. The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and spreads rapidly, bringing hues of purple, pink, and blue. Although some consider lupine to be a threat to native plants, it is welcomed by many as a cherished part of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in Reykjavík, near the Skógafoss waterfall, and lining the road to the Hellissandur Church in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, as seen in today's image.","date":"Jun 18, 2024","bsTitle":"'Lupin' into summer","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240618_LupinIceland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5037957bd73adbf02a00d00780a9853e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
