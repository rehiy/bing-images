Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.","date":"May 1, 2024","bsTitle":"'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii Nei'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240501_HawaiianLei%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6f7ccfc486cb720ee51181d3e1d0daa4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
