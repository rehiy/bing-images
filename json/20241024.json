This mining camp became a booming gold rush town in the 1870s, after a cave-in revealed a rich vein of gold. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.","date":"Oct 24, 2024","bsTitle":"Ghosts of the gold rush","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241024_BodieCalifornia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"116124d1c3d2c56e90c4047654de37e8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
