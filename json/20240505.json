Not to be confused with Mexico's Independence Day, Cinco de Mayo instead marks Mexico’s 1862 triumph over France at the Battle of Puebla. The holiday is observed in Mexico but has become popular in the US since the 1980s thanks to various advertising campaigns. Here it has evolved into a wider celebration of Mexican culture, whether it is food, history, art, or the colorful architecture of cities like San Miguel de Allende, established in the 16th century, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.","date":"May 5, 2024","bsTitle":"Happy Cinco de Mayo!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240505_SanMiguelAllende%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5db2d89d38b5f4c43239598770290629","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
