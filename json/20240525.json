Come to Aït Benhaddou, Morocco, on the old caravan route linking the Sahara to Marrakesh. This UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases Moroccan earthen clay architecture, made using sun-dried mud. Although none of the buildings here are believed to predate the 17th century, they are constructed using techniques and styles that are much older. Located on the gentle slopes overlooking the Asif Ounila (Ounila River) the Ksar of Aït Benhaddou is a fortified village, clustered within a defensive wall with corner towers. The ksar's communal landscape includes a public square, a mosque, grain-threshing areas beyond the fortifications, and a caravanserai—a type of roadside inn, among other features. So, if you are seeking a journey off the beaten path, Aït Benhaddou awaits you.","date":"May 25, 2024","bsTitle":"Guardians of the dunes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240525_MoroccoBenhaddou%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9041e06b96a0de5a48e7da520d52eb95","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
