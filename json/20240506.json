Its strange name comes from the French 'les roches,' which means 'the rocks.' Rising to a height of over 1,600 feet, the ridge is a popular destination for climbers and hikers in the Peak District National Park. It offers stunning views over the moorland and, if you're lucky, you may spot a wallaby! A number of these Australian marsupials escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s, and there are still recorded sightings of the descendants of the original wallabies.","date":"May 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Where is this rocky ridge?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240506_TheRoachesPeakDistrict%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e54f20c2443d6da2a7ba22466b391947","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
