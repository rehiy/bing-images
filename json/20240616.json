Father's Day is the perfect time to celebrate everything they do for us, how they look after us, help us grow up, and tell the best dad jokes. There are also great dads in the animal kingdom, like the foxy father seen in today's image. Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging. The foxes seen here are melanistic, a condition in animals that results in darker coloring.","date":"Jun 16, 2024","bsTitle":"This father won't be outfoxed","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240616_RedFoxDad%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d09bd7fa201c38ba6569e875443a1a45","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
