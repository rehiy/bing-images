If you haven't had time to take part, we've got your back. Let us take you to Guadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas. The park, officially established in 1972, covers 86,416 acres. Here, the Guadalupe Mountains rise over the salt dunes of the Chihuahuan Desert and include the highest point in Texas, the 8,751-foot Guadalupe Peak. Pictured on today's homepage is another iconic landmark, El Capitan. Not to be confused with its famous namesake in California, this limestone cliff towers 8,085 feet high and is often used as a waymark for travelers. Even if National Park Week is over, there are plenty of days in the year to visit the country's abundant natural splendor.","date":"Apr 28, 2024","bsTitle":"Let's park here","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240428_GuadalupeTexas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"47d396257a11a41f22b3b7cbfee8877c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
