This day is about honoring and protecting the world's oceans and serves as a reminder of the critical role oceans play in supporting life on Earth. These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae, and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.","date":"Jun 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Waves of hope","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240607_HumpbackFamily%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"41d0d180374debabcd13fe17f988e963","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
