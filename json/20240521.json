Whether you like Darjeeling, Earl Grey, oolong, matcha, or English breakfast, today's the day to celebrate this beloved brew: May 21 is International Tea Day. People have been drinking tea for at least 5,000 years. The drink originated in China, but in the 16th and 17th centuries, it was introduced to Western merchants, who helped to spread it around the world. It is now the second-most consumed drink in the world after water.","date":"May 21, 2024","bsTitle":"A brew-tea-ful day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240521_MalaysiaTea%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"28ad3e0702e3bb8cbab18cc9df30f5ce","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
