This South Asian megacity on the Ganges Delta, home to over 10.2 million people, is one of the world's most densely populated cities. Dhaka has been nicknamed 'City of Mosques' because of the hundreds of elegant minarets that dot the city. Here, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and colorfully decorated rickshaws, recognized by UNESCO as an important example of cultural heritage, meander through the streets. Even by rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognized as the world's slowest city. So, whether you're weaving through its alleys or sampling its spicy street foods, take the time to savor everything Dhaka has to offer.","date":"Jun 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Dark night, city lights","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240623_DhakaBangladesh%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"63e6b0607b36dac568219ce1b4ecd09c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
