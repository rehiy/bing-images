Many will recognize Skellig Michael, the island on our homepage, as the location of scenes from the 'Star Wars' sequels, 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi.' This UNESCO World Heritage Site appears in the movies as the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi master Luke Skywalker seeks refuge. Home to a 6th-century monastery with beehive huts and stone staircases, it also hosts a large seabird population that inspired the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To. Skellig Michael is about 7 miles off Ireland's southwestern coast, daily visitors are limited, and boat trips are canceled if it is too stormy. Still, the island attracts 'Star Wars' fans and others keen to see this ancient site, not so very far, far away.","date":"May 4, 2024","bsTitle":"May the Fourth be with you!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240504_JediMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"606ff54b1d6c852b2982b30474424299","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
