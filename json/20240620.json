Today is the longest day of the year, known as the summer solstice, which happens when one of the Earth's poles is most inclined toward the sun. Today's image features the Kokino megalithic observatory, part of a wider archaeological site in North Macedonia. It is believed that it marked the position of the sun during summer and winter solstices, as well as the equinox, and consists of two platforms. A stone block on the upper platform of the observatory indicates the summer solstice sunrise direction when seen from a seat on the lower platform. This Bronze Age astronomical wonder sits more than 3,300 feet above sea level, on a hill overlooking the hamlet of Kokino.","date":"Jun 20, 2024","bsTitle":"Sunrise on the solstice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240620_KokinoMacedonia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"97b61f1bf7beb80f97abc629b48ba966","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
