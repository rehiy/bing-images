It's Pollinator Week, celebrating the creatures which transport pollen to help plants reproduce. While some plants are self-pollinating, or pollinated by wind or water, the majority of them are fertilized with the help of bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, birds—like the green-crowned brilliant hummingbird in today's image—and even bats. The non-profit organization Pollinator Partnership initiated Pollinator Week to raise awareness about the protection of these creatures. This celebration is now being joined by other programs and educational events around the country. Should we care? Absolutely! From fruits and veggies to nuts, chocolate, or sugarcane, there are plenty of ingredients in our diet that are brought to us by pollinators.","date":"Jun 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Spread the pollen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240617_HummingThistle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dc3056d211c2762763d08053dfaeabd2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
